## [0.8.0] — 2026-09-09

Version 0.8 adds protocol-version-scoped declarations and deterministic views for each supported MCP protocol version.

It also introduces reusable components, richer examples and interaction scenarios, client capability requirements, elicitation declarations, extension support, and stronger validation across JSON and YAML documents.

The accepted proposals represented by this release are listed in the [0.8.0 proposal revision manifest](https://github.com/mcpdesc/mcpdesc-specification/blob/v0.8.0/spec/0.8.0/PROPOSALS.md).

### Breaking

- Removed `info.protocolVersion` and added required root `protocolVersions` using the closed set of MCP revisions whose semantics 0.8.0 validates (Proposal 0001).
- Changed root `capabilities` from one object to an array of protocol-scoped Capabilities Objects (Proposal 0001).
- Replaced inline security definitions with named root `securitySchemes` and Security Requirement Arrays (Proposal 0003).
- Required every Tool to contain an object-rooted `inputSchema` (Proposal 0001).

### Added

- MCP `2026-07-28` support and protocol applicability across transports, capabilities, and primitive declarations (Proposal 0001).
- Deterministic Effective Protocol Views with projection and conflict-detecting merge behavior (Proposal 0001).
- Root `instructions`, formal MCP extension declarations, and primitive `clientRequirements` (Proposals 0001, 0012).
- Named Tool, Resource, Resource Template, and Prompt examples, plus Tool interaction and completion examples (Proposals 0004, 0005, 0015, 0016, 0017).
- Reusable typed `components` referenced through local `$componentRef` objects (Proposal 0009).
- Operation-level elicitation declarations and object-level `x-*` specification extensions (Proposals 0007, 0011).
- JSON and restricted YAML serializations, canonical versioned schema URIs, and expanded semantic validation (Proposals 0010, 0019).

### Changed

- Defined the root Info Object as document-wide metadata independent of MCP protocol revisions, preserving all Info properties during migration and projection and removing runtime `Implementation` availability gates (Proposal 0022).
- Made `transports` optional and defined omission of an optional section as no declaration rather than evidence of runtime non-support (Proposal 0013).
- Required ordinary declaration collections to be non-empty when present and projection or merge to omit collections that become empty (Proposal 0013).
- Defined MCP 2025-06-18 as the floor for complete revision-specific semantic validation; older recognized revisions produce incomplete-validation diagnostics (Proposals 0001, 0002).
- Aligned Tool, Resource, Resource Template, Prompt, annotation, `_meta`, and extension validation with their applicable MCP revisions (Proposals 0001, 0002).
- Treated pre-standard or unrecognized MCP extension declarations and unresolved external Tool schema references as warning-and-preserve conditions (Proposals 0001, 0021).
- Distinguished MCP 2025-11-25 core Tasks from MCP 2026-07-28 Tasks extensions (Proposal 0001).
- Made active specification examples vendor-neutral and removed bundled vendor-specific extension metadata (editorial).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-23

### Changed
- **Simplified tags to flat structure** — removed hierarchical nesting. The Tag Object no longer includes a recursive `tags` property. All tags are now declared in a flat array at the root level.
- **Tag uniqueness requirement simplified** — tag names MUST be unique across all tags (previously "across the entire tag tree").
- **Tag reference validation simplified** — per-entity tags must reference tag names declared in the root `tags` array (no nesting levels to traverse).
- **Added `uniqueItems: true` constraint** to per-entity `tags` arrays on tools, resources, resource templates, and prompts to prevent duplicate tag references.

### Removed
- **Removed hierarchical tag support** — Tag Objects no longer support nested `tags` arrays. The tag taxonomy is now a simple flat list.

### Updated
- **Section 12 (Tags)** — completely rewritten to reflect flat tag structure. Removed hierarchical examples and references to "tag tree" and "nesting levels".
- **All examples** — converted from hierarchical tags to flat tag lists (stdio-server, http-server, full-featured examples in both JSON and YAML formats).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-20

### Removed
- **Removed the `metadata` object** from the root document structure. The `authors`, `documentation`, and `repository` fields are redundant with `info.contact` and `info.websiteUrl`, or belong in vendor extensions.
- **Removed the `lifecycle` object** from the root document structure. Server lifecycle management belongs in a server manifest or registry, not in a static capability description.

### Added
- **Root-level `tags` array** with structured Tag Objects (`name`, `description`, `tags`) replacing `metadata.tags`. Tags support hierarchical nesting via nested `tags` arrays (Option C). Tag names MUST be globally unique across the entire tree.
- **Tag reference validation requirement** — per-entity `tags` on tools, resources, resource templates, and prompts MUST reference tag names declared in the root `tags` array when present. Undeclared tag references are a validation error.

### Changed
- **Section 12** rewritten from "Metadata" to "Tags" — defines the Tag Object, uniqueness constraints, and tag reference semantics.
- **Sections 9, 10, 11** — per-entity `tags` description updated with normative cross-reference to Section 12.3 tag declaration requirement.
- **Section 3** root object table — `metadata` and `lifecycle` rows removed; `tags` row added.
- **Sections renumbered** — removal of lifecycle (formerly Section 12) shifts Tags to 12, Specification Extensions to 13, Serialization to 14, Conformance to 15.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-03-18

### Changed
- **Documented MCP `Implementation` type provenance in the Info Object** — `name`, `title`, `description`, `version`, `icons`, and `websiteUrl` are now explicitly traced to the MCP `Implementation` type returned in the `initialize` response (`serverInfo`), with protocol version annotations:
  - `title` — MCP `BaseMetadata`, since 2025-06-18
  - `description` — MCP `Implementation`, since 2025-11-25
  - `websiteUrl` — MCP `Implementation`, since 2025-11-25
  - `icons` — MCP `Implementation` (via `Icons` mixin), since 2025-11-25
- **Updated Info Object example** to include `icons` and `websiteUrl` fields
- **Clarified `contact` and `license`** as OpenAPI-style additions not present in the MCP `Implementation` type

## [0.5.1] — 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **Removed `_generated` from the core MCP Description specification** (`mcpdesc: "0.5.1"`), including the root object definition and current schema.
- **Updated Cisco extension to `x-cisco-metadata` v0.2.0 shape** with extension-level `version` and nested `dump` payload
- **Removed `_generated` from Cisco extension examples**, with provenance retained in `x-cisco-metadata.dump` (`toolName`, `toolVersion`, `createdAt`)

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **Renamed `transport` field to `transports`** (plural) for consistency with `tools`, `resources`, `prompts` and OpenAPI's `servers` — see [DECISION-001](https://github.com/mcpdesc/mcpdesc-specification/blob/v0.8.0/docs/maintainers/design/mcp-description/DECISION-001-transports-array.md)
- **Added transport-scoped `security`** — each transport MAY include its own `security` array that overrides the root-level default (see Section 6.4)
- Root-level `security` is now the default; transport-level `security` overrides it (OpenAPI-style inheritance)

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-16

### Added
- MCP 2025-11-25 support: icons, websiteUrl, task capabilities, tool execution properties
- Tool `outputSchema` with explicit `$schema` dialect support (MCP 2025-06-18+)
- Tool `execution.taskSupport` property for task-augmented execution (MCP 2025-11-25 only)
- `icons` definition for server, tools, resources, resource templates, and prompts
- `capabilities.tasks` for task-augmented request support
- `capabilities.completions` and `capabilities.logging` declarations

### Changed
- **Renamed `mcpspec` field to `mcpdesc`** to clearly distinguish the description format version from the MCP protocol specification version
- `protocolVersion` enum now includes `2025-11-25`
- Tool `annotations` now supports `additionalProperties` for forward compatibility

## [0.3.0] — 2026-01-15

### Added
- `title` field on all MCP entities (BaseMetadata, since MCP 2025-06-18)
- Tool `outputSchema` for structured tool output
- `_meta` protocol-reserved metadata on tools, resources, resource templates, and prompts
- `tags` for categorization on tools, resources, resource templates, and prompts
- `deprecated` flag on tools, resources, resource templates, and prompts

### Changed
- Aligned more closely with MCP 2025-06-18 protocol structures

## [0.1.0] — 2025-11-01

### Added
- Initial specification draft
- Core document structure: `mcpspec`, `info`, `transport`, `tools`, `resources`, `resourceTemplates`, `prompts`
- Transport definitions: `streamable-http`, `stdio`, `sse`
- Security schemes aligned with OpenAPI 3.1
- `capabilities` object from MCP InitializeResult
- `metadata` for authors, documentation, repository, tags
- `_generated` provenance tracking
- Specification extension mechanism (`x-` prefix)
- `anyOf` constraint requiring at least one of tools, resources, resourceTemplates, or prompts
